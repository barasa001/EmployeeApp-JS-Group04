# Employee Management App - (Advanced Edition)

 Here, we'll leverage Node.js, data storage solutions (MySQL or MongoDB), caching, and web development skills to elevate the application's performance and feature set.

## Objectives

- Leverage Node.js to establish a server-side environment for the web app.
- Implement data persistence using either MySQL or MongoDB for employee data storage.
- Integrate caching mechanisms to optimize data retrieval.
- Enhance the existing app with advanced features like update, delete, filter, and sort functionalities for employee data management.
- Explore advanced database concepts such as functions, views, and triggers.
- Implement a queuing system to handle asynchronous tasks and integrate file management capabilities for storing employee-related documents.
- Develop a user-friendly web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Setting Up the Repository (Group Activity)

1. Create a new GitHub repository named "EmployeeApp-JS-GroupXX".
2. Initialize the repository with a README.md file.
3. Create a directory structure as described above.

## Part 1: Server-Side Setup with Node.js (Group Activity)

1. Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your development machines.
2. Within the project directory, initialize a new Node.js project using `npm init -y`.
3. Install Express.js, a popular Node.js web framework, using `npm install express`.
4. Create a new file named `server.js` to house the server-side code.

## Part 2: Advanced Data Storage with MySQL or MongoDB (Group Activity)

### Option A: MySQL

1. Install a MySQL database server.
2. Create a database and a table to store employee data.
3. Establish a connection to the MySQL database using a Node.js library like `mysql2`.
4. Implement CRUD operations for employee data using MySQL queries within your `server.js` file.

### Option B: MongoDB

1. Install a MongoDB database server.
2. Create a database and a collection to store employee data as documents.
3. Establish a connection to the MongoDB database using a Node.js library like `Mongoose`.
4. Implement CRUD operations for employee data using Mongoose queries within your `server.js` file.

## Part 3: Caching with Node.js (Group Activity)

1. Install a caching library like Redis or memcached using npm.
2. Implement a caching strategy to store frequently accessed employee data in memory for faster retrieval.
3. Update your server-side code to check the cache first before querying the database for data.

## Part 4: Advanced Features and Queuing (Group Activity)

1. Enhance Employee Management functionalities.
2. Integrate a message queuing system like Redis or RabbitMQ to handle asynchronous tasks.
3. Implement file management capabilities for storing and managing employee-related documents.

## Part 5: Web Interface and Deployment (Group Activity)

1. Create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to build a user-friendly web interface.
2. Integrate forms for adding, updating, and deleting employees.
3. Design tables or lists to display employee information effectively.
4. Update the interface to accommodate functionalities like updating, deleting, and managing employee documents.

## Part 6: Testing and Deployment (Group Activity)

1. Implement unit tests for your server-side code using testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha.
2. [Optional] Deploy your web application to a free cloud hosting platform like Heroku for accessibility from anywhere.
3. Implement integration tests to ensure seamless interaction between different components.
4. [Optional] Deploy your web application to a cloud hosting platform for accessibility.
